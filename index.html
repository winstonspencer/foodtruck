<main><p>Abulita's Food Truck started with family. Emilia & Julieta moved to the US with thier family about 10 years ago. Helping in thier abuleita's garden, it grew so large they couldn't give all the produce away.
Abulita encouraged her granddaughters to start one of the first food trucks in Elizabeth City and it became a huge success very quickly.</p>
<p>They call thier grandmother "Abulita" so naturally they named the food truck after her. That's where the name comes from. Five years later, business is better than ever.</p> </main>
