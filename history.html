    <p>The Food Truck started with humble beginings in 2011, with a farm in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which is still in operation, which provided the food truck in downtown Elizabeth City.</p>

        Abuelita's is a one of kind of Food Truck with hopes of opening a brick and mortar in the near future. We have a growing catering business, that serves the needs of our local community. Abuelita's has high hopes and ambitions to continue to expand as
        a hospitality business in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Abuelita's currently makes all of its corn torrillas and salsas, which is a crowd pleaser.
